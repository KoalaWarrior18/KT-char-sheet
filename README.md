Basic C++ Code to run attacks for my character in a 3.5 DnD game.

-Version 0.1 consists of the MainMenu and Attack screen working, also allowing you to select from a couple different weapons to attack with

-If any of the provided melee weapons do not suit your needs, you are able to select a generic melee option, which gives userinput into the damage of the weapon
